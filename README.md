# 🧠 Code-Crack-Game
Final Game in Devil's Plan Season 2

Dear Jean 🕵️‍♀️

Welcome to your personalized challenge, Jean! 💌
You’ve been chosen to crack a secret 8-digit code — a task only the clever, charming, and incredibly brilliant could hope to complete (yes, that's you).

🎯 Objective:
Figure out the secret 8-digit code made up of numbers from 1 to 9, each one carefully placed by your favorite CEC (Chief Executive Cuddler).

🛠️ How It Works:
You may ask as many questions as you like to get closer to the truth. Use logic, intuition, and your signature flair to reveal the code!

🧩 Available Questions:

- Positional Sum – What’s the total of any 3 card positions?
- Total Code Sum – What’s the sum of all 8 numbers?
- Specific Value Count – How many of a certain number (like 7s) are in the code?
- Matching Value Positions – Which positions have the same number?
- Consecutive Value Positions – Where do numbers appear consecutively?
- Highest Number Position – Where is the biggest number hiding?
- Lowest Number Position – Where is the smallest number hiding?

🏆 Winning Condition:
Once you crack the code, text me the code to claim your reward. Something sweet awaits you (besides me 😉).

You got this, Jean.

With love and admiration,

Quinn
